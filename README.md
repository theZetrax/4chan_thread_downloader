# 4Chan Thread Downloader

This program is built using C# and .NET Core. A console applicaiton built for downloading 4Chan thread images.

## Installation

This program worked for me on linux, not tested on Windows or MacOS. Perl is required, at least 5.30.*. Install DotNet 5.0 from Microsofts page [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theZetrax/4chan_thread_downloader.git
cd /ThreadDownloder
dotnet build # Check if build is successful
dotnet run
```

**Note:** All downloaded files will be in the thread directory inside of a downloads folder in the `/ThreadDownloader` directory.
